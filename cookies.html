You can set your browser to refuse all or some cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. However, if you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our website may become inaccessible or not function properly. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to modify your cookie settings.</p>

                    <p>You can opt out of targeted advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance's opt-out portal or the Network Advertising Initiative's opt-out tool. These industry-developed programs allow you to reject targeting cookies from many major ad networks. Note that opting out doesn't mean you won't see ads - it means the ads you see may be less relevant to your interests.</p>

                    <p>Some browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser "Do Not Track" signals as there is no industry standard for implementation. However, we provide you with alternative control options through our cookie consent tool and privacy settings.</p>

This manager allows you to control which websites can store information on your computer, delete specific Flash cookies, or prevent Flash content from storing data altogether.

                    <p>Many third-party services we use offer their own opt-out mechanisms for their tracking technologies. For example, Google Analytics provides a browser add-on to opt out of their analytics tracking. We maintain a list of these third-party opt-out options in our privacy center. These opt-outs are specific to each provider and may require separate actions beyond our cookie consent tool.</p>
